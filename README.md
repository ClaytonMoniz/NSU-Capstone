## Testing Information
Testing was done using PyAutoGUI and by simply playing the game.
PyAutoGUI was only used to test the StartMenu, and Information Buttons, and the GameOver CheckBox.
It was also used to test Keyboard input for the player.
After that all other testing was done by hand since the other forms share the same structure and it was easy enough to test by hand.
[Here](testing) is the folder containing all the images and the python file.
## Assets
All of the asset images I used are free and open source I am not a good artist so this was the best thing for me to use.
- Here are links to all the assets they can also be found in [this](Links_For_Assets) folder.
